# Password Generator Application

## Description
This is a password generator web app that will ask a few questions to construct a password, then display the password in the main text area.  It was a homework project designed to apply the JavaScript we have learned to date.  It uses concatenation, a for loop, and randomization, among other JavaScript codes. (Note that for this app to run correctly, it must be reloaded between password generations.)
